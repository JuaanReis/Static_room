> A place to chill and chat with someone during the late night, unload your thoughts with images, texts, and a public chat — a museum of ideas.

| Situation                    | Solution                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feeling inspired?            | Make an image that shows your emotions       |
| Got an idea?                 | Share it in the chat and take it forward     |
| Bored but it’s daytime?      | Wait it out, the best shows only air at night |

## What is it?

Static Room is a virtual space for you to freak out, relax, and connect with the night owls. Time stands still here, the vibe gets wild, and the chat flows freely — with images, texts, and sounds that feel like they came from a dream.

---

## Why?

Because not everyone wants to sleep, and sometimes you just need a place to vent without filters. Here, the night is your ally, and chaos is welcome.

---

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (Chrome or Firefox work best)
3. Step into Static Room, throw your ideas, memes, feelings, and dive into the conversation

---

## Technologies

- HTML/CSS/JS
- Real-time public chat (you can use WebSocket or Firebase to keep it simple)
- Image manipulation to express your feelings
- Glitchy visual animations and effects that mess with your head (in a good way)

---

## Next steps

- Improve the chat with emojis and commands
- Create animated avatars and bizarre interactive characters
- Make the site react to the user's time and mood
- Add late-night sounds, noises, and random background music

**Static Room** — where the night becomes a refuge (or so I hope).
